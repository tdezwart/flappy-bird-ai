This Python game was created using the "AI Plays Flappy Bird"-tutorial of Tech With Tim on YouTube. It consists of two files:

- FlappyBirdAI.py   - the original script where the AI learns to play Python using neural networks and genetic evolution.
- FlappyBird.py     - a modified version where the user is able to play the game
